# Week 1‚Äì3 Exercises

This folder contains my practice work from Weeks 1 through 3 of the Helsinki Python MOOC.


# number_summary
A small program to calculate sum, mean, and track positives/negatives from user input.

This was one of the first programs I wrote where several pieces of Python started to click. It includes a while loop, conditionals, math, and user input ‚Äî and it was one of the first times I felt truly proud of writing something that worked.


# next_leap_year
A logic puzzle wrapped in a riddle disguised as a math problem. This had me stumped for a time, but I *did* conquer it‚Äîand now it stays here forever as a trophy of pain and progress.


# working_with_numbers
I enjoyed this one. It was in 4 parts (technically 5 with pre-task). It kept adding new conditions and I had to figure out the order of the varying counters to make sure only the information I wanted was included in them. It had been a long day and I was going to wait until after I slept but I took my time and enjoyed piecing it together. A nice woohooo! before the zzz.


# üìÅ Strings Subfolder

I created a `strings/` subfolder to keep all my Week 3 string slicing exercises organized.  
This is where I‚Äôll collect anything related to string manipulation, slicing, and possibly rage-typing.

Check it out: [`strings/`](./strings/)
