# ðŸ§µ String Slicing Exercises

This folder contains my string manipulation and slicing exercises from Week 3 of the Helsinki Python MOOC.
Expect some slicing, dicing, indexing, and maybe a little frustration, but nothing a cat with scissors canâ€™t handle.
This is actually my second time going through week 3 and so far (knock on wood) some of what frustrated me before is slightly clearer now.


# end_to_beginning

A short script that takes a word and prints it in reverse, one letter per line.

I am sure for some of you this is nice and easy, but I actually had a lightbulb moment here, well a few. Before I had to keep changing "index" to "location" which could make it confusing when instructions keep saying index. The terminology is sticking now though this time around. Also the clearer realization of index = len(string) is going to get me a character count and is not trying to get a location. I think that was a sticking point for me in later exercises the last time I did these.


# second_and_second_to_last_characters

Takes a word and looks at the second and second-to-last characters, then lets the user know if they are the same or different.

I actually felt a minor victory here for myself. The derp and slight brain fog stayed away as I figured it out.
